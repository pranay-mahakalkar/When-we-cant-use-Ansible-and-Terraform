#In this scenario, Python allows you to create custom data processing pipelines, incorporating various libraries and functions specific to your needs. 
#Python's flexibility and extensive ecosystem make it well-suited for tasks like this, where the logic is complex, data-centric, and 
#requires interaction with multiple services and data sources.
