Scenario: Complex Data Ingestion and Processing

Suppose you work for a data analytics company, and your task is to automate the ingestion and processing of large volumes of data from various sources, perform complex transformations, and load the results into a data warehouse.

Using Ansible: Ansible is excellent for automating infrastructure provisioning and configuration. However, in this scenario, the task is less about infrastructure and more about data manipulation. While Ansible could potentially be used to deploy data processing servers and services, it's not ideal for handling the intricacies of data transformations and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.

Using Terraform: Terraform is suitable for provisioning infrastructure but not for data processing tasks. It can set up the cloud resources you need, such as VM instances or data storage, but it doesn't inherently have the capabilities to perform data transformations.

Using Python: Python is a strong choice for this scenario. You can write custom Python scripts to:

Connect to data sources, retrieve data, and validate its quality.
Apply complex data transformations, such as cleansing, aggregation, or enrichment.
Interface with various APIs and services to move data around.
Load the processed data into a data warehouse or storage system.
